    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish from Rome, known for
      its creamy texture and rich flavor. The dish traditionally includes
      ingredients like eggs, hard cheese (typically Pecorino Romano or
      Parmesan), pancetta or guanciale (Italian cured meat), and freshly ground
      black pepper. Unlike many creamy pasta dishes, Carbonara does not use
      cream; instead, the creaminess comes from the emulsified mixture of eggs
      and cheese, which coats the hot pasta. The result is a delicious,
      comforting meal that's quick and easy to prepare.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>400g (14 oz) spaghetti</li>
      <li>150g (5.3 oz) pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>
        1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese (plus extra for
        serving)
      </li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook
        until al dente according to package instructions. Reserve about 1 cup of
        pasta water, then drain the spaghetti.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add
        the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until crispy, about 5-7
        minutes. If using garlic, add it to the pan and saut√© for about 1 minute
        until fragrant. Remove the skillet from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated cheese until well
        combined. Season with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the pasta is cooked and drained, return it to the pot or a large
        mixing bowl. Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta,
        stirring vigorously to combine. The heat from the pasta will cook the
        eggs, creating a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add some
        reserved pasta water a little at a time until you reach the desired
        consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the crispy pancetta (and garlic if used) into the pasta. Mix
        well to ensure the pancetta is evenly distributed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plate the Carbonara immediately, garnishing with additional grated
        cheese, freshly ground black pepper, and chopped parsley if desired.
        Serve hot.

    </ol>
