    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Jollof rice is a popular West African dish, enjoyed for its rich,
      flavorful taste and vibrant color. The dish is a staple in countries such
      as Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, and Sierra Leone, each with their unique
      variations. Jollof rice is primarily made with long-grain parboiled rice,
      tomatoes, onions, and a blend of spices. It's often served with fried
      plantains, grilled or fried chicken, beef, or fish, and can be customized
      with vegetables like peas, carrots, and bell peppers. The distinct red or
      orange hue of Jollof rice comes from the tomato base, making it both
      visually appealing and delicious.

      <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped (divided)</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger, minced</li>
      <li>1 can (400g) crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1 scotch bonnet or habanero pepper, chopped (optional, for heat)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
      <li>2 cups mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, green beans) (optional)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove
        excess starch. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add half of the chopped onions and sauté until translucent.</li>
      <li>
        Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for about 2 minutes until
        fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chopped bell pepper and optional scotch bonnet or habanero
        pepper, and cook for another 3-4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the crushed tomatoes and tomato paste, and cook for 10-15
        minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomato mixture thickens and
        the oil begins to separate from the tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add paprika, thyme, curry powder, and bay leaves to the tomato sauce.
        Stir well to combine.
      </li>
      <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>
        Pour the chicken or vegetable broth into the tomato sauce and bring to a
        boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the rinsed rice to the pot, stirring to ensure the rice is evenly
        distributed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and
        simmer for 20-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is
        absorbed. Avoid opening the lid too often to prevent the steam from
        escaping.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using mixed vegetables, stir them into the rice about 10 minutes
        before the rice is fully cooked. This will ensure the vegetables are
        tender but not overcooked.
      </li>
      <li>Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork.</li>
      <li>Adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
      <li>
        For extra flavor, you can garnish with the remaining chopped onions,
        sautéed in a bit of oil until caramelized, and some fresh herbs like
        parsley or cilantro.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the Jollof rice hot, with your choice of protein (chicken, beef,
        fish) and fried plantains on the side. Enjoy!
