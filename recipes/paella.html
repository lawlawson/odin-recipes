    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken and chorizo paella is a flavorful and hearty version of the
      classic Spanish paella. This dish combines tender pieces of chicken and
      spicy chorizo sausage with a fragrant blend of saffron-infused rice,
      tomatoes, and a variety of vegetables. Originating from the Valencia
      region of Spain, paella is traditionally cooked in a wide, shallow pan,
      which allows the rice to cook evenly and develop a crispy bottom layer
      known as "socarrat." This particular version of paella is rich in taste
      and color, making it a festive and satisfying meal.

      <li>1 yellow bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>2 cups paella rice (such as Bomba or Arborio)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
      <li>1 can (400g/14 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon saffron threads, soaked in 2 tablespoons warm water</li>
      <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Lemon wedges and chopped parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces and slice the chorizo.
        Finely chop the onion, mince the garlic, and dice the red and yellow
        bell peppers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large paella pan or wide, shallow skillet over
        medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken pieces and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7
        minutes. Remove the chicken and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chorizo to the pan and cook until it releases its oil and
        becomes slightly crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Remove the chorizo and set
        aside with the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pan, add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about
        5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the minced garlic and diced bell peppers, and cook for another 3-4
        minutes until the vegetables are softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the paella rice and cook for 2 minutes, allowing it to absorb
        the flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the white wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits
        from the bottom. Cook until the wine is mostly evaporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the diced tomatoes, smoked paprika, and the saffron along with
        its soaking liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the chicken broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Season with
        salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low and return the chicken and chorizo to the pan,
        mixing them evenly with the rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer uncovered for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is tender
        and most of the liquid is absorbed. Avoid stirring the rice to allow the
        socarrat to form.
      </li>
      <li>
        About 5 minutes before the rice is done, scatter the frozen peas over
        the top of the paella. Continue cooking until the peas are heated
        through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the paella is cooked, remove it from the heat and let it rest for a
        few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with lemon wedges and chopped parsley before serving.</li>
    </ol>
